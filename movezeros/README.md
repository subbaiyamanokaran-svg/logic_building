IN this code You have to swap the numbers if arr[i]!=0 it is the important one 
---
    let the numbers be like 1,2,0,3 
First it will see 1 which is not eqauls 0 then swap takes place between left and i which is same like 0,0
then left will increment and i will increment as per the loop
---
then the swap takes place as 1,1 
    then increment -> left=2,i=2
the same
---
    now arr[i]=0 
which leads to skip the increment of the left then 
    left=2 but i =3 
as by the loop
---
now the next elemnt is 3
which is a non-zero number so the condition 
    arr[i]!=0 true 
then the swap takes place then the final outcome is 
    1,2,3,0

# In this the algorithm is important read carefully!
